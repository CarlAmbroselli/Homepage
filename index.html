      <p><span class="headline">Hi I'm Carl.</span><br><br>I finished my <span class="highlight">bachelor</span> studies in June 2015 and work on my own <span class="highlight">startup</span> called <span class="highlight">Mastermind</span> now. I have a lot of experience in <span class="highlight">mobile</span> and <span class="highlight">web</span> development. I am pretty good in developing well-tested, robust solutions in a very short amount of time. <span class="highlight">Security</span> is something I was also always interested in and I won many Security-CTF events. In my spare time I love going surfing or snowboarding with friends and doing parkour.</p>
